# Quantitative Momentum Strategy For Picking Top FTSE Stocks

With tens of thousands of stocks to choose from, how do we go about selecting a few worth buying? Stock news, uncertainty and emotions add to the bitterness of this process. Whatever some experts suggest, it is impossible to go through all balance sheets to identify companies with low net debt and improving net profit margins.

This article uses a simple quantitative momentum strategy using Python and Refinitiv's DataScope Select (DSS) API to filter and select the best Intraday stocks. Given the breadth of the reference and pricing data available via DataScope Select, the APIs are ideal to build desktop applications which need a data source to populate data fields and graphs.

The DataScope Select APIs offer programmatic access to Refinitiv content in a more flexible way than the browser- and FTP-based data access solutions. They can be used to create an infinite number of client applications written in any desired programming language, for example, C#, C++, Visual Basic, Java, Objective-C and Swift. It supports the management of instrument and entity lists, report templates and schedules for the purpose of requesting extractions. It also supports higher level calls that can make data extractions directly, without requiring the creation of instrument lists, report templates or schedules on the DSS server.
